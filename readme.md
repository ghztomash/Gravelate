# Gravelate
Gravel focused map-theme for [OpenAndroMaps](https://www.openandromaps.org/en).
Based on Elevate originally by [Tobias Kuehn](http://www.eartrumpet.net/contact/).
Inspired by the [Pizza Gravel](https://www.instagram.com/pizzagravel) community.

# Features
* Adds layer for emphasized gravel paths (marking `gravel`, `fine_gravel`, `compacted` and `pebble` surfaces), allowing for easily spotting surfaces when scouting and planning routes.
* Adds layer for track grades (color coded from grade 2 to grade 5), to distinguish for cruising forests paths and gnarly trails.
* Combines cycling and mountain bike profiles together with layers.
* Adds Public transport network from City layer for easy spotting bailout points.
* Adds road access layer (to de-clutter the view when navigating).
